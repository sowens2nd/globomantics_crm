# Module 6 - Deploying the Python requests Library
This directory contains Python code samples using the `requests`
library on version `2.22.0`. The "homework assignment" solution
is in `delete_device.py`. The remaining Python files are discussed
in the course. The `json_ref/` directory contains the HTTP body
text that came back in a variety of HTTP responses used in the
course. These are just references as the data within them is
stale, but they can be useful as references for troubleshooting
and data formation.
